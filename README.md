# The Idea Vault

A collection of hackathon ideas. Peruse at your leisure!
## Organization

Each file represents one hackathon idea/challenge and contains a general description of the problem. View them as ideas that serve as starting points, and please build on top of them in whatever direction you find the creative winds guide you.

If you have tackled any of the ideas please consider submitting a pull request where you add yourself to the list of showcases. 
## Metadata

Each file has a few [properties](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties) attached to it for easy organization. The current set of expected keys are:

- date: `Date` - the year, month, and day the note was _created_
- tags: `string[]` - a list of tags
## Showcases

We very much would like to gather all your wonderful hacks into a list of showcases to inspire future participants. Each file has a section called "Showcases" where you can add yourself to the list. Please add yourself to the **end** of the list!

This is the format
- [Title with a link](https://example.com) - Summary
