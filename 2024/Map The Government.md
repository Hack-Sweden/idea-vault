## Challenge

The state, regions and municipalities all work similarly. They have a "regering", "region-styrelse", or "kommunstyrelsen" that is elected by the "riksdag", "regionfullmäktinge", or "kommunfullmäktige". The politicians are elected every four years and are representatives of their electorate. However, each of these institutions organizes their work differently. Work is split into working groups with names in the style of "utskott", or "nämder", where the politicians create proposals that are voted on.  Which "utskott" or "nämnder" exists is up to the politicians in that region and so is how their political decisions are implemented by "myndigheter", "förvaltningar" or publicly owned companies and affect Swedish citizens.

Questions that I would like to answer:
- What "nämnder" are there?
- What "förvaltningar" are there?
- What publicly owned companies are there?
