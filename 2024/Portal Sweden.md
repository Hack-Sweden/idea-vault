## Challenge

Can we make it easier to find information from public institutions in Sweden? One idea is to create a search index for websites by Swedish authorities.

Types of content:
- government agency websites
- regional websites
- municipality websites
- etc
- I know that some municipalities offer online services for things like building permits
