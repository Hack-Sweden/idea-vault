## Challenge

There are a lot of different state/region/municipality programs to provide help to individuals, and organizations. It would be nice if there was some nice portal that gathered it all in one place.

Example:
- I remember as a student I was able to apply for scholarships that awarded me ~20k x 3 = ~60k for being a student from Uppsala. It was awesome! I only found out about it through friends so I'm sure there are a lot of students from Uppsala that miss out.
