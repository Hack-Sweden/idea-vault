## Challenge

I recently got sick and tried to figure out how "karensavdrag" would affect my pay in different scenarios. I think It would be awesome if there was a web app that allowed me to select which days I was sick, and calculate how it would affect my salary.

	- Note: I think the video is wrong. They say the woman would get paid a salary even if she was only sick for a single day but from my understanding, the first 8 hours are always unpaid.
