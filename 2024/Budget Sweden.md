## Challenge

I want to be able to view the budgets of the government, regions, and municipalities in one easy-to-use web app. Maybe you can visualize the budgets using [treemaps](https://recharts.org/en-US/examples/CustomContentTreemap)

Note that there are a lot of budgets:
- 1 state
- 20 regions
- 290 municipalities

Ideas:
- Start with doing 1 municipality by hand to get a feel for the scope.
- How do you scale collecting the data? 
	- Can it be done manually?
	- Do you have to build a tool like a web-scraper?
