## Challenge

I want the money that is spent on digital services and consultants to fund open-source initiatives. One way of pushing Sweden in this direction would be by creating a ranking website where all government agencies, regions, and municipalities would be rated in their open-source maturity.

Possible inputs that affect the ranking:
- Do they have a GitHub organization? (Gitlab, bitbucket, etc)
- How many open-source repositories do they have
- How many stares do the repositories have?
- Do they have a public website?
- etc
