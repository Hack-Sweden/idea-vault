## Challenge

There is a phenomenon on the internet where people create lists of "awesome" stuff on the internet centred around some theme. Examples:
- [Awesome list of awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
- [gamemakes](https://github.com/bytecauldron/awesome-gamemaker#readme)
- [fonts](https://github.com/brabadu/awesome-fonts#readme)

Right now there is a bunch of awesome open-source stuff that Swedish municipalities, regions, universities, and authorities have created and made public that we don't know about. It would be fantastic if someone would create a curated list to both guide people on what is out there and let people be inspired by what is possible.

Here are some ideas for what you could look for:
-  Can you find GitHub organizations controlled by public institutions?
- Maybe you find resources created by [Digg](https://www.digg.se/)
- Look through the websites of public authorities and see if you find some links
	- [here is an index of all public authorities](https://www.regeringen.se/myndigheter-med-flera/)

Maybe there are synergies with the [[Portal Sweden]] or [[Open Source Ranking]] ideas?
