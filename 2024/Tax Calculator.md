## Challenge

A lot of Swedes are ignorant about how our tax system works. Could we create a tool/resource that educates Swedes on how different taxes work?  

Examples:
- different types of investment accounts: ISK, AF, KF
- Income tax
	- Municipality Tax
	- State Tax
	- Employee Tax
- Sales Tax (moms)
